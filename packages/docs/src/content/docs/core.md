# UI-Schema Core

The UI Schema core consists of `Providers`, `Renderers`, the plugin system and validators.

It supports different ways of creation and UI orchestration, focused for a great developer experience and fast UIs.

> todo: document the entry point styles of the FlowChart and their usage here, use the other `Core` docs as component documentations
