# Kit DnD - Drag 'n Drop Tools

A Drag 'n Drop toolkit based on `react-dnd` to simplify coding draggable lists and grid systems.

```bash
npm install --save @xy-form/kit-dnd immutable react-dnd

# it doesn't require any other module of `@xy-form`
```

Especially made in mind of endless nested grids and automatically generated UIs, to be compatible with any data structures (most likely).

Build around a stateless coordination system and calculating the intended UI and data actions by intended-movements (e.g. drag-hover by mouse).


> ðŸš§ Work in progress, experimental [#159](https://github.com/ui-schema/ui-schema/issues/159)
>
> At the moment requires that the `dataKeys` (data-coordinates) is an immutable `List`.

## Style & Animation

There is none, it's stuff around logic, there isn't any HTML included.

Use a simple `flex` layout, and you are ready to go.
