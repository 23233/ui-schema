# Kit DnD - for easy Drag 'n Drop in React

A Drag 'n Drop toolkit based on `react-dnd` to simplify coding draggable lists and grid systems.

```
npm install --save @ui-schema/kit-dnd immutable react-dnd

# it doesn't require any other module of `@ui-schema`
```

Especially made in mind of endless nested grids and automatically generated UIs, to be compatible with any data structures (most likely).

Build around a stateless coordination system and calculating the intended UI and data actions by intended-movements (e.g. drag-hover by mouse).

> At the moment requires that the `dataKeys`  (your-apps data-coordinates) is an immutable `List`.
>
> When and if support without immutable is added is unclear.

## Style & Animation

There a none, it's just bringing an ease around logic, there isn't even any HTML included.

Use a simple `flex` layout, and you are ready to go.
