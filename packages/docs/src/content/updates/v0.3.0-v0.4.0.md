# Update Notes v0.3.0 to v0.4.0

Check the [github release notes](https://github.com/ui-schema/ui-schema/releases) for latest releases, this page focuses on breaking changes of core logic.

> ðŸš§ `v0.4.0` is the *next version*, **fix the version exactly!**
>
> *for now* `v0.4.0-alpha` only includes [`mui@v5` #167](https://github.com/ui-schema/ui-schema/issues/167) changes and no other breaking changes

## Material v5

Updates `material-ui@4` to `mui@v5`, please consult [mui.com for the theme migration](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/migration-v4).

> ðŸš§ atm. `@mui/styles` is required as `peerDepencency`, will be removed after migration is finished

### MUI Pickers

The pickers where rewritten for the new [MUI-X pickers package](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/).

See [new docs](/docs/material-pickers/Overview) vs [old docs](/docs/widgets/DateTimePickers).

> ðŸš§ they do not support all old (`<=v0.3.0`) features yet and are very-basic (only handling *basic* `value`-parsing/`onChange`)
>
> e.g. custom `x` format is not supported yet
